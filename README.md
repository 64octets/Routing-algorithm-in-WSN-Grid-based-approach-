# Routing-algorithm-in-WSN-Grid-based-approach-
The algorithm shows how the sensed data from the sensor nodes is being routed to the sink efficiently.The energy of the sensor nodes is very less and the cost of transmitting data of 1Kb from the  sensor nodes to a distance of 100 meters is same as performing 3 billion instructions in a general purpose register.Thus there is a requirement in minimising the number of transmissions and length of transmission and every node in the network must be covered . So a Grid is chosen of dimensions m*m (where m is maximum distance the node can communicate) and among all the nodes a centre head is chosen where all the nodes in the grid sends the data to the cluster head and all the cluster heads sends data to nearest cluster head to save the energy until it reaches the sink
